## Installation

To install this app, the player will need to go to the webpage listed below and follow the prompts.

<a href="https://aqueous-fortress-78837.herokuapp.com/">Character Creation Link</a>

# Usage

Once the player goes to the webpage, they will be prompted by a start button to begin character creation. If they have already created a character, they can then search for the character by the ID given to them at the end of character creation.

The start button connects them to the Character Creation page where they can select their specicies, class, name, and stats with dropdown menus. The proficiencies page is where you will allow you to select proficiencies for your character based off of your class.

Once the character has been created, they will be taken to their character sheet which is generated based off of the selections they made.

If a character needs a spell, the player can select a spell on our spell sheet. There are explanations of each spell listed in alphabetical order.
